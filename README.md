## About

This repository automatically tracks and archives official exchange rates (USD and EUR) from banks operating in Suriname. The process is executed on a private server and stored in a transparent, auditable format.

## Purpose

- Collect, verify, and log foreign exchange rates from official bank websites
- Maintain full traceability of HTTP requests and responses
- Commit and register each snapshot in Git history
- Create a GitHub Issue for every rate snapshot with labels by **bank**, **currency**, and **type (buy/sell)**
- Generate a daily **summary issue** that links all the others
- Support public audits and transparency in Suriname’s exchange markets


## Integrity and Compliance

- Every snapshot includes `request.json`, `response.json`, and `results.json`
- Traceroute and DNS data included to verify authenticity
- Git history acts as public audit trail
- Each commit is immutable and timestamped
